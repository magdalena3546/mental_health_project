# Student Mental Health Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the mental health issues among students using a MySQL database. The analysis includes the distribution of various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, as well as their correlation with demographic and academic factors.

Taking care of mental health is extremely important, especially for students who often face significant academic and social pressures. By understanding the prevalence and distribution of these issues, we can better address and support student mental health needs.
